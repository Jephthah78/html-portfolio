<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>In 2009, while working at the bank as a Rigour Officer, I was appointed as a Part-Time Lecturer in Computer Skills by the University of Zambia for two (2) semesters. I realized my potential in growing my computer skills further and so I later embarked on a progressive study of programming since I had already acquired the theoretical know-how in Programming and Web Strategies through my Management of Information Systems Professional Qualification under IMIS.</p>

<p>I gave up my banking job in 2020 after having worked as a Bank Manager for over 9 years and soon after started studying Web Development and Business Intelligence Analysis at the same time.</p>

<p>These two programs have so far enabled me to acquire excellent skills in basic Web Development and Business Intelligence Analysis such as HTML5, MYSQL, Advanced Statistics, TABLEAU, integrating SQL with TABLEAU; and I am in line to acquiring additional skills in JQUERY, BOOTSTRAP, Linux Command, APIs, Flexbox, Grid, Node.JS, React, Mobile Applications, Mongo DB, Python and many more Complete Web Development software packages.</p>
