<h1>The Best Movies According to Jephthah</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Mamma Mia!</h3>

<p>I consider the first part of this two-part music movie as a dedication movie to my daughter especially the song that goes with the lyrics 'slipping through my fingers all the time...!' And the great part is that she loves it,too!</p>

<h3>Lucy</h3>

<p>This is a great sci-fi movie featuring Morgan Freeman as the Great Scientist holding a colloquium to prove his modern-day thesis/ theory of the cerebral capacity if applied at more than 10% all the way up to 100%.<br /> He goes on to use his 'Revolution' argument instead of 'Evolution' as he calls it in order to try to justify the cerebral power that we humans have to the point of controlling other humans, computers, machines, including electronic as well as electrical signals-if the cerebral capacity that we possess is applied to full capacity (i.e 100%).<br /> I like the idea of 'unexplored cerebral zones' as mentioned at some point in the movie!</p>

<h3>Head of State</h3>

<p>This movie features Chris Rock as the Black American who maneuvers his way up through the election campaigns to become the Black President of the USA.<br /> I like the dancing and the debate part as Blacks and Whites mingle happily together with dances and applauds! </p>
